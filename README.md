DESCRIPTION
=============
This is my version of a Slim Framework Skeleton Application (for a [shared hosting at OVH](http://www.ovh.com/fr/hebergement-web/) with PHP & PHP-FPM - works fine on other hosting companies).

I did it for my (french) [blog](http://poinsot.info). No new post for a while, sorry... I'm currently working on a brand new version.


USING
=============
 * HTML5 Boilerplate Apache configuration file : http://html5boilerplate.com/
 * Slim Framework : http://www.slimframework.com
 * Slim Views : https://github.com/codeguy/Slim-Views
 * Twig : http://twig.sensiolabs.org
 * Redbean : http://redbeanphp.com
 * Twitter Bootstrap : http://getbootstrap.com


PHP-FPM & OVH
=============
Remove the .ovhconfig file if your website is not hosted at OVH using a shared hosting offer (with PHP-FPM).


TWIG CACHING
=============
Uncomment the "'cache' => DIR_CACHE" line in index.php (line 170) if you want Twig to display compiled templates (and speed up the rendering).
